                    Originally settled by Neolithic man from the late Stone Age, 
                    Bratislava later held a high status in the second century BC 
                    as an important Celtic defence and trading post. The Romans built military camps here 
                    – one of which, Gerulata, lies under the modern suburb of Rusovce. Bratislava first appears in written records in the 10th century, 
                    when it was part of the Moravian Empire, but it was annexed by Hungary in the 11th century.
                    From 1536 to 1783, Bratislava was the capital of Hungary, known as Pozsony. Despite its population being decimated by plague in 1711, Bratislava 
                    reached its zenith in the mid-18th century under the patronage of Empress Marie Theresa. Maria Theresa’s successor was considerably less able however, 
                    and only three years after her death, the Hungarian capital became Budapest once more. Bratislava was besieged by Napoleon’s troops in 1809. T
                    he castle was burnt down in 1811.
                    <br><br>
                    Attempts were made to gain greater autonomy from Hungary, but following the establishment of the Dual Monarchy in 1867, 
                    Slovak culture was heavily suppressed. Until 1918, the city was a 'resort' area of Austria-Hungary, called Pressburg in German. 
                    In 1919, the city was annexed to the Czechoslovak Republic.
                    During WWII, a quasi-Nazi government was established in Slovakia. An armed uprising against this government in 1944 was crushed.
                    Slovakia’s long years under Communist rule following the war were interrupted only once, briefly, when the reformist policies of Bratislava-born Party 
                    Secretary Alexander Dubček led to the Prague Spring of 1968 – after which the Soviet tanks rolled in.
                    <br><br>
                    After the fall of Communism in 1989, Bratislava restored its Old Town and soon became a popular visitor destination.
                    When Czechoslovakia split in 1993, Bratislava became the Slovak capital, joining the EU in 2004.

                        Bratislava has a moderately continental climate with four distinct seasons; therefore, there is a 
                        significant difference between summer and winter. During summer, the temperature can rise up to 30°C, 
                        occasionally even higher. During winter, the temperatures are around 0°C, but at night, 
                        they can get lower than -10°C. It can also snow, but usually, the snow cover will not last for more than few days.

                    <strong>Bratislava Castle</strong>
                    <br>
                    The castle obtained the rare shape already in in the 9th century but the strategic position has been held much earlier. 
                    Since the mid-16th century, when Bratislava became the coronation city of the Hungarian Kingdom, 
                    council meetings enganged the castle and the coronation jewels were stored here. In 1811 the castle burnt down and was reconstructed only in the 60s. It is has become a national cultural monument since 1961. 
                    Currently it is still being partially reconstructed , yet accessible for the visitors.

                    <strong>Devin Castle</strong>
                    <br>
                    Devin castle spreads on the hill above the crossroad of two important rivers of this region: 
                    Danube and Morava, which form a natural Slovak border with Austria and Czech Republic. 
                    Nowadays, the castle remains as a museum and the surrounding is shaped with landscape of walls, 
                    staircases, open courtyards and gardens.

                    <strong>St. Martin's Cathedral</strong>
                    <br>
                    St. Martin's cathedral is one of the most significant symbols of Bratislava. 
                    It was built in the 12th century and almost immediately became the center of an everyday life. 
                    Originally a Roman architecture has been converted in the Gothic style in the 13th century and remained till today.

                    <strong>UFO outlook tower</strong>
                    <br>
                    UFO tower has been built just above the New Bridge, which is actually the 7th largest hanging bridge in the world 
                    and incredibly shapes the panorama of Bratislava. It was built in the 70s and has been voted to be the building of the century in Slovakia. 
                    In 2005, the restaurant was reopened and the new open-air outlook place and two modern bars were added.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Michael's gate and tower</strong>
                    <br>
                    This 51m high tower above the gate with its green copper roof is one of the best known and the oldest buildings in Bratislava. 
                    It was built in the 14th century as one of the four gates into the city. A small pedestrian bridge over the summer reading garden leads there. 
                    In front of the gate, there is a small cannon, which invites visitors to the very top of the tower with an Museum of Weapons, 
                    as well as a great outlook onto the streets of Bratislava.
